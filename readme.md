## Heat transfer Determination

The accuracy of a thermomechanical simulation depends on thermal parameters and the description of the heat transfer.
This software enables the determination of the heat transfer coefficient between workpiece and tools,
based on an experimentally determined temperature development. The challenge here is the continuous change of
the workpiece temperature and no equilibrium is achieved. The experimental data and a detailed description of
the experimental setup is published in doi [Link will be inserted].
